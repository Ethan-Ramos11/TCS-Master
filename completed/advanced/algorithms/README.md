## Purpose

- Provide clear, well-documented implementations of common algorithms
- Serve as a reference for algorithm analysis and optimization
- Demonstrate best practices in algorithm implementation
- Support learning and understanding of algorithmic concepts

## Usage

Each algorithm implementation includes:

- Clear documentation
- Time and space complexity analysis
- Example usage
- Test cases where applicable

## Contributing

When adding new algorithms:

1. Create a new directory for the algorithm
2. Include a README.md with:
   - Algorithm description
   - Complexity analysis
   - Implementation details
   - Usage examples
3. Add appropriate test cases
4. Follow the existing code style and documentation standards
