# TCS Master Repository

I've created this repository as a comprehensive showcase of TCS (The Coding School) projects and learning materials. I've organized it to help students track their progress and showcase their work effectively.

## Repository Structure

```
TCS-Master/
├── templates/           # Empty project templates I've created for students to start with
├── completed/          # Example completed projects I've built for reference
├── work-in-progress/   # Projects I'm currently developing or updating
└── documentation/      # Project documentation, guides, and resources I've created
```

### Directory Purposes

- **templates/**: Contains starter templates I've created for all projects. These are clean, empty versions that students can use as a starting point.
- **completed/**: Houses example completed projects I've built that demonstrate proper implementation and documentation.
- **work-in-progress/**: For projects I'm currently developing or updating.
- **documentation/**: Contains guides, tutorials, and other resources I've created to help students learn and complete projects.

## Project Categories

I've organized the projects into the following categories:

1. **Beginner Projects**

   - Calculator
   - Dice Roller
   - Number Guessing Game
   - Basic Todo List

2. **Intermediate Projects**

   - Tic Tac Toe
   - ATM System
   - Grade Calculator
   - Restaurant Management System

3. **Advanced Projects**
   - Card Games
   - Database Projects
   - Web Applications
   - Full-stack Applications

## Getting Started

Here's how I recommend getting started with these projects:

1. Choose a project from the templates directory
2. Copy it to work-in-progress
3. Follow the project documentation
4. Commit your changes regularly
5. Move to completed when finished

## Git Workflow

I use this simple Git workflow in my projects:

1. Create a new branch for each project
2. Make regular commits with clear messages
3. Use pull requests for code review
4. Merge completed work into main

## Contributing

While this is primarily my teaching repository, I welcome collaboration and feedback from other instructors and students. If you'd like to contribute:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch for your work
3. Make regular commits
4. Submit pull requests for review
5. Keep your work organized in the appropriate directories
